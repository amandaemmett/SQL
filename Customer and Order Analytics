In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

/* How many orders where placed in January? */
SELECT count(*) FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
/*9681*/

/* How many of those orders where for an iPhone? */
SELECT count(*) FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE product="iPhone" 
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
/*379*/

/* Select the account numbers for all of the orders placed in February*/
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum FROM bit_db.customers
INNER JOIN bit_db.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=Febsales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


/* What product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price? */
SELECT DISTINCT product, price FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1
/* AAA Batteries (4-pack), 2.99 */

/* What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? */
SELECT SUM(quantity*price) revenue, product FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product

/*Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? */
SELECT product, quantity, (quantity*price) total_revenue FROM bit_db.febsales
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
/* AA Batteries (4-pack), 2, 7.68 */

/*How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?*/
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum) customers, ROUND(AVG(quantity*price),2) avg_spent
FROM bit_db.febsales
JOIN customers
ON febsales.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE quantity>2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id<>'Order ID'
/*278, 13.83*/

/*List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.*/
SELECT product
, SUM(quantity)
FROM bit_db.febsales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product

/*Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?*/
SELECT DISTINCT location
,COUNT(orderID)
FROM bit_db.jansales
WHERE length(location)>16
AND location like '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID)>=3
